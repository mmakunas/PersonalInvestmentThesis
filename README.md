# PersonalInvestmentThesis
This is my personal “investment” thesis. Much like an financial investment thesis, its purpose is to guide decisions on how resources are allocated. But these resources are not money ([at least not directly](http://phish.net/song/money-love-and-change/lyrics)). What is being allocated is my time, thoughts, and effort as it applies to the [“external” me](http://www.themonsterinyourhead.com/2011/05/05/work-life-balance-is-bullshit/). That is, my creative work output. Writing this down is, in essence, a more formal way of approaching what I’ve always done. Which is think about the future and where it is going and how I can affect that change. But, by formalizing it and writing it down, I am attempting to prevent the pull of “shiny new things (and ideas)” Without this, it’s just stuff stewing in my mind that is, often, disconnected with what I do. And there is no real test of if what I am doing is meaningful to me versus just interesting. This attempts to resolve that and provide a lense to filter my decisions through.
